### **Problem:**

Ignoring an error **without explicitly marking it** makes it unclear whether the omission was intentional or a mistake, leading to potential debugging and maintainability issues.

---

### **Solution:**

‚úÖ **Use `_ = functionCall()` to explicitly ignore an error.**  
‚úÖ **Add a meaningful comment explaining why the error is being ignored.**  
‚úÖ **Favor logging errors instead of ignoring them completely.**

---

### **Best Practices:**

‚úÖ **Always explicitly mark ignored errors with `_ = ...`.**  
‚úÖ **Provide a reason in a comment if the error is intentionally ignored.**  
‚úÖ **Consider logging errors even if they are non-critical.**

---

### **Bad Example (Ignoring an Error Without Indicating Intent)**

```go
func f() {
	notify() // ‚ùå No indication whether ignoring this error was intentional
}
```

üî¥ **Why is this wrong?**

- **Future maintainers won‚Äôt know if this was a mistake or intentional.**
- **Debugging is harder because errors are silently discarded.**

---

### **Good Example (Explicitly Ignoring the Error with `_ =` to Indicate Intent)**

```go
func f() {
	_ = notify() // ‚úÖ Makes it clear the error is intentionally ignored
}
```

üîµ **Why is this better?**

- **Clearly signals that the error is being ignored on purpose.**
- **Reduces ambiguity in code reviews and debugging.**

---

### **Best Example (Providing Context for Ignoring an Error)**

```go
func f() {
	// At-most once delivery.
	// Hence, it's acceptable to miss some notifications in case of errors.
	_ = notify()
}
```

üîµ **Why is this the best approach?**

- **Provides a valid justification for ignoring the error.**
- **Helps future developers understand why handling the error isn‚Äôt necessary.**

---

### **Alternative Approach (Logging Non-Critical Errors Instead of Ignoring Them)**

```go
func f() {
	if err := notify(); err != nil {
		log.Printf("non-critical error in notify: %v", err) // ‚úÖ Logs the error instead of ignoring it
	}
}
```

üîµ **Why use this?**

- **Preserves error information without interrupting execution.**
- **Useful for debugging intermittent failures.**

---

### **When to Use Each Approach:**

|**Scenario**|**Recommended Approach**|
|---|---|
|**Error must be ignored entirely**|Use `_ = functionCall()`|
|**There is a justification for ignoring an error**|Add a meaningful comment|
|**The error is non-critical but might be useful for debugging**|Log the error (`log.Printf`)|
|**The error should be handled properly**|Use standard error handling|

---

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **Use `_ =` to explicitly ignore errors, making intent clear.**
- **If ignoring an error, provide a comment explaining why.**
- **Favor logging non-critical errors instead of discarding them completely.**
- **Unclear error handling leads to debugging difficulties‚Äîbe explicit.** üöÄ
