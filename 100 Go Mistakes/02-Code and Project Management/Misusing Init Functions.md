### **Problem:**

Misusing `init` functions in Go can lead to poor error handling, increased complexity in testing, and reliance on global variables. Since `init` functions do not return errors, they force error signaling through `panic`, which removes flexibility in handling failures. Additionally, global state initialization in `init` complicates unit testing and makes the code harder to maintain.

### **Solution:**

1. **Avoid using `init` for critical initialization** – Instead, use dedicated functions that return errors and allow the caller to decide on error-handling strategies.
2. **Encapsulate dependencies** – Avoid setting global variables; instead, return initialized values from functions to improve testability and maintainability.
3. **Use `init` only for simple, non-failing setup** – Suitable use cases include static configuration like registering HTTP handlers, where no error handling is needed.

By limiting `init` usage to safe, side-effect-free operations, Go programs become more robust, testable, and maintainable.
