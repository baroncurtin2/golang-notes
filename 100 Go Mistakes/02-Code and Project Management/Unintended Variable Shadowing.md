### **Problem:**

Variable shadowing in Go occurs when a variable in an inner scope is unintentionally redeclared using `:=`, leaving the outer variable unchanged. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as an uninitialized (`nil`) variable.

### **Solution:**

1. **Use Temporary Variables** – Assign results to a temporary variable and then explicitly update the outer variable.
2. **Use Direct Assignment (`=`)** – Predeclare the variable outside the block and use `=` to ensure updates apply to the intended variable, improving clarity and maintainability.
