### **Problem:**

Overusing getters and setters in Go can lead to unnecessary complexity and verbosity. Unlike some other languages, Go does not enforce encapsulation through getters and setters by default, and its standard library often allows direct field access. Using getters and setters without a strong reason goes against Go’s simplicity and idiomatic practices.

### **Solution:**

1. **Avoid unnecessary getters and setters** – Direct field access is preferred unless there’s a clear need for encapsulation, such as validation, computed values, or concurrency control.
2. **Use getters and setters pragmatically** – If needed, follow Go’s naming conventions (`Balance()` for getters and `SetBalance()` for setters) and ensure they add real value, like enforcing constraints or managing synchronization.
3. **Emphasize Go’s simplicity** – Stick to Go’s idioms and only introduce abstraction layers when they improve maintainability, flexibility, or debugging.

By using getters and setters only when necessary, Go code remains clean, efficient, and aligned with its design philosophy.
