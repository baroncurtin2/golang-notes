### **Problem:**

Interface pollution occurs when code is overwhelmed with unnecessary abstractions, making it harder to understand and maintain. Many developers coming from languages like Java or C# tend to create interfaces preemptively, even when they aren’t needed. This leads to unnecessary indirection, reduced readability, and increased complexity.

### **Solution:**

1. **Discover Interfaces, Don’t Design Them** – Interfaces should emerge naturally when they serve a concrete purpose, such as defining a common behavior, decoupling implementations, or restricting behavior.
2. **Avoid Premature Abstraction** – Instead of designing interfaces upfront, rely on concrete implementations first and introduce interfaces only when they provide real benefits, such as testability or flexibility.
3. **Challenge the Need for an Interface** – If an interface doesn’t clearly improve the code’s readability, reusability, or maintainability, consider removing it and using direct implementation calls instead.

By adhering to Go’s philosophy of simplicity, developers can avoid unnecessary abstractions and keep their code clear, efficient, and maintainable.
